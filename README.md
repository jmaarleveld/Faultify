## Byte Code Dotnet Mutation Utility
Faultify provides a quick simple way to realize dotnet mutation testing at the byte code level. 
It imitates the bad programmer by deliberately introducing errors. 
A test is assumed to fail after an introduced mutation. If it succeeds, the test is likely to be error-prone and problematic.

Faultify is targeted at .NET Core 3.0+ projects and does not support Xamarin nor .NET Framework.

*disclaimer: faultify is just released and bugs can be expected, please open a issue if you get any.*
